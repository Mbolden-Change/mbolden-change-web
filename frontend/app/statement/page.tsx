          Executive Order 14281, signed by President Trump on April 25, 2025,
          declares that ‚Äúa bedrock principle of the United States is that all
          citizens are treated equally under the law.‚Äù We agree.
        </p>{' '}
        <p>
          But equality under the law is not simply a matter of formal words or
          good intentions. It requires <strong>equal protection</strong>‚Äîand
          that means confronting both <strong>overt discrimination</strong> and{' '}
          {''}
          <strong>the unjust effects of facially neutral policies.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Without protections like disparate impact standards, laws and
            policies can become a cover for injustice,
          </strong>{' '}
          allowing systemic discrimination to persist beneath a veneer of
          neutrality‚Äîmaking inequity harder to detect, harder to challenge, and
          easier to deny. By ignoring real-world impacts, the law itself becomes
          a tool for gaslighting marginalized communities, dismissing the
          barriers they face as personal failings rather than systemic design.
        </p>
        <p>
          True equality under the law demands accountability for how systems
          work‚Äîand who they work for. By eliminating disparate impact
          protections, this Executive Order undermines the very constitutional
          commitments it claims to uphold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the rhetoric of fairness, this order does not protect
          individual rights. It protects entrenched power. It rolls back decades
          of civil rights protections that were created precisely because
          facially "neutral" policies can‚Äîand do‚Äîperpetuate racial, gender, and
          economic inequality without explicit intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Here's the truth: Disparate impact isn‚Äôt about guaranteeing equal
            outcomes. It‚Äôs about recognizing when supposedly neutral systems
            produce discriminatory results‚Äîand giving communities a way to
            challenge them.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If a hiring practice, a lending rule, or a housing policy
          systematically disadvantages people of color, women, disabled
          individuals, or other marginalized groups‚Äîeven without overt
          discrimination‚Äîthat‚Äôs not meritocracy. That‚Äôs systemic exclusion.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>
          What This Executive Order Gets Wrong
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>It distorts the reality of discrimination.</strong>{' '}
            Discrimination today is often structural, not overt. It happens when
            barriers are baked into policies, practices, and standards that
            appear neutral but produce deeply unequal results. Disparate impact
            law acknowledges that ignoring the unjust effects of facially
            neutral policies reinforces systemic inequality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>It weaponizes "neutrality."</strong> Pretending not to see
            race, gender, or other forms of structural disadvantage doesn‚Äôt
            create fairness. It creates willful ignorance. True equity requires
            acknowledging the forces that shape opportunity‚Äîand acting to
            dismantle them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>It undermines accountability.</strong> Disparate impact
            standards exist because without them, there is no meaningful check
            on policies that disadvantage whole communities. Rolling back these
            standards tells businesses, governments, and institutions: as long
            as your policies sound neutral, you can ignore the real-world harm
            you cause.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>It rewrites the purpose of civil rights law.</strong> Civil
            rights protections were never meant to address only overt
            discrimination. They were designed to root out patterns of
            disadvantage wherever they exist. This order turns that commitment
            upside down‚Äî limiting civil rights protections precisely where they
            are most needed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>
          Why Disparate Impact Protections Matter
        </h3>
        <p>Real-world examples make it clear:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Housing:</strong> Blanket bans on tenants with prior arrests
            disproportionately impact Black and minority renters‚Äîeven when no
            discriminatory intent is shown. The United States has the highest
            incarceration rate in the world, and tens of millions of Americans
            have some form of criminal legal system contact‚Äîwhether an arrest or
            conviction. Even an arrest record alone, without a conviction, can
            be grounds for denial of housing. The overbroad reach of the
            criminal legal system is not experienced equally: communities of
            color, particularly Black and Latino communities, are
            disproportionately policed and incarcerated. Without disparate
            impact protections, these systemic inequities are compounded in
            housing access.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lending:</strong> Seemingly neutral lending practices have
            long denied women and communities of color access to credit. Until
            1974, women often needed a male cosigner to obtain a mortgage or
            credit card. Today, facially neutral policies like heavy reliance on
            credit scores can disproportionately disadvantage women, who
            historically face wage gaps and career interruptions. Without
            disparate impact protections, it will be harder for women to enforce
            their financial rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Employment:</strong> Hiring criteria and workplace practices
            that appear neutral can disproportionately exclude qualified
            candidates from marginalized communities. Overreliance on degree
            requirements, criminal background checks, gaps in employment
            history, or "cultural fit" assessments often screen out Black,
            Latino, Indigenous, and women job seekers, even when those factors
            are unrelated to job performance. Structural inequities like unequal
            access to higher education, over-policing, and caregiving
            responsibilities fall hardest on marginalized communities,
            compounding exclusion in hiring, retention, and promotion. Without
            disparate impact protections, employers are less accountable for
            ensuring that employment practices truly promote opportunity based
            on skill and potential‚Äî not hidden bias.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healthcare:</strong> Healthcare systems and policies that
            seem neutral can reinforce and exacerbate disparities across race,
            gender, income, disability, and geography. Systemic discrimination
            plagues healthcare delivery, contributing to higher maternal
            mortality rates among Black women, underdiagnosis and mistreatment
            of women's pain, disparities in cancer screening and treatment, and
            delayed or denied care for people with disabilities. Insurance
            policies that fail to account for these systemic barriers
            disproportionately leave marginalized communities underinsured or
            uninsured. Diagnostic algorithms that rely on biased historical data
            can underestimate illness severity in people of color and women.
            Without disparate impact protections, healthcare systems are less
            accountable for correcting inequities that result in preventable
            illness, suffering, and early death.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Voting</strong>: Seemingly neutral voting laws‚Äîlike strict
            voter ID requirements, polling place closures, and reduced early
            voting windows‚Äîdisproportionately burden Black, Brown, disabled,
            young, and low-income voters. Without disparate impact protections,
            barriers to the ballot box become harder to challenge‚Äîeven as they
            systematically erode democratic participation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Without the ability to challenge policies based on their outcomes,
          historically marginalized groups lose critical tools for enforcing
          their rights and accessing opportunities that were denied to past
          generations.

          What True Equality of Opportunity Requires
        </h3>
        <p>
          If we are serious about advancing equality of opportunity‚Äînot just
          preserving privilege under the guise of neutrality‚Äîwe need policies
          that address barriers to opportunity at every stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          A real commitment to equality of opportunity requires taking action
          across key areas to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Strengthen and Enforce Disparate Impact Protections</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                {' '}
                Reinforce the principle that true equality requires examining
                impact. Intent matters. Impact matters more.
              </li>
              <li>
                Despite the Executive Order, disparate impact liability under
                Title VII of the Civil Rights Act remains intact, as codified by
                Congress in 1991. Private employers and institutions must
                understand: the law still stands‚Äîand individuals retain the
                right to challenge practices that disproportionately exclude or
                disadvantage protected groups.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Expand Access to Fair Credit and Lending</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Strengthen the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to account for
                historical barriers faced by women and communities of color.
              </li>
              <li>
                Monitor and regulate credit scoring and AI-driven lending
                practices that replicate past discrimination.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advance Labor Equity</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Raise the federal minimum wage and eliminate subminimum wages.
                When work provides stability and a living wage, people can
                pursue education, invest in the future, and participate fully in
                civic life.
              </li>
              <li>
                Expand access to paid family leave and caregiving supports to
                ensure caregiving doesn‚Äôt penalize workers‚Äîespecially women.
              </li>

                Invest in K-12 education, especially in historically underfunded
                communities. Quality education should not depend on a child‚Äôs

              <li>
                Support expanded access to higher education for marginalized
                groups through scholarships, support programs, and outreach
                initiatives.

              <li>
                Strengthen anti-discrimination protections in healthcare
